* Lore of the game:
  * Location: Alien planet, not inhabited(?) except for fungal spores -> turn humans into zombies on contact (incubation period?)
  * planet currently undergoes terraforming process, workers are living under a dome to protect themselves from the fungus
  * options for space travel:
    1. FTL-Engine
    2. Wormholes/Hyperspace
    3. Warpdrive (or similar technology based on the alcubierre drive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive)
  * ballistic guns are still in use
  * usage of (prototype) laser-/plasma-based guns(?)
  *
* story mockup:
  * player wakes up after accident/comes back from exploration(?) 
  * terraforming device seemingly caused the collaps of the dome
  * player finds object that allows to travel back-and-forth between now and the time before the accident (time in the past progresses in realtime)
  * player tries to undo what happened
  * plot twist: the terraformer isn't (the only) reason for the accident
  *
* Additional thoughts:
  * coming back from exploration would open up a few interesting options:
    * would allow to include non-zombie npcs -> one of them the bad guy
    * maybe only two (one female one male), player has to choose between those two, the other one gets injured and isn't able to help the player, in the end the other one turns out to be the atagonist/person who caused the accident
    * player can help the npc(s) but the more the player helps the easier the game at the beginning but the harder to get to the good ending
